Using the console log

console.log(30)
console.log(0)

// Opening line
console.log('It was love at first sight.');
consolel.log(/*IGNORED!*/)
console.log('The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.');
console.log('Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.');
console.log('The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn\'t quite jaundice.');
console.log('If it became jaundice they could treat it.');
console.log('If it didn\'t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.');
console.log('But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.');

console.log('JavaScript Location of Codeacademy headquarters: 575 Boradway, New York City');
console.log(2011);
console.log('Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy');
console.log(20.49);

console.log(30 + 3.5); // plus
console.log(2021 - 1969); // subtract
console.log(65 / 240); // divide 
console.log(0.2708 * 100); // multiply

console.log('Hello' + 'World'); 
console.log('Hello' +' '+ 'World')

console.log('Teaching the world how to code'.length); //Prints 30

console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase()); // Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim()); // Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.

/* Review
Let’s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
/* There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides. */ 

// Using variables (var)
var favouriteFood = 'pizza';

var numOfSlices = 8;

console.log(favouriteFood); // it would show pizza
console.log(numOfSlices); // it would show 8

// Changable variable (let)
let changeMe = true
changeMe = false

console.log(changeMe); // it would show as false

// Constant variable (cont)
const entree = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(entree); // this would show Enchiladas
entree = 'Tacos' // This would bring up an error message as it's false

// Maths with let
let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
 
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
 
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4

// I edited some of the equations below by reassigning the value with a +=, -=, *= and /=
let levelUp = 10;
levelUp += 5;
let powerLevel = 9001;
powerLevel -=100
let multiplyMe = 32;
multiplyMe *= 11;
let quarterMe = 1152;
quarterMe /= 4;

// String Concatenation with Variables
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); // Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
